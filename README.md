Function Variable+ : I created three functions that all had their own variable, one of those being their color. In the draw function I used RGB to chnage their color
Sprite Change: I used the avatar I made in class(addFace, and a new sprite (labRat). Using a if-else statement, I made it so my addFace would be replaced by labRat if the mouse was pressed.
